About the eSim Marathon and IHP SG13G
The eSim Marathon - Circuit Design & Simulation with IHP SG13G2 is a nationwide circuit
design competition where participants use eSim , an open-source EDA tool developed by
FOSSEE, IIT Bombay, to design and simulate circuits using the IHP SG13G2 PDK ,
a 130 nm open-source BiCMOS technology from IHP Microelectronics, Germany. The
marathon promotes self-reliance and innovation in VLSI by offering a complete, open tool and
PDK chain for tapeout-ready digital design.

Abstract
This project details the specification, design, simulation, and physical implementation of a
high-speed, area-efficient Mod-N counter employing Vedic arithmetic and Kogge-stone adder
logic. The modulo parameter was set to N = 100 throughout. The design targets tapeout
and conforms to real foundry requirements. The report presents theoretical background,
methodology, verification, physical flow, and innovative features.

1 Introduction
Digital counters are essential modules in SoCs, timing circuits, and DSP systems. The drive
for speed, power, and area efficiency motivates new arithmetic techniques for hardware
designers. Using both ancient Vedic mathematics and the modern Kogge-stone adder, this
project pioneers a Mod-N counter with N = 100 optimized for performance and silicon
tapeout.

2 Objectives
Design a scalable Mod-N counter (with N = 100) for high speed and low area.
Utilize Vedic mathematics and Kogge-stone logic for fast increment and efficient
terminal count detection.
Develop a tapeout-ready design with compliant pin assignments and physical design
flows.
Validate through comprehensive RTL, pre-synthesis simulations, post-synthesis
simulations, and physical layout verification.
3 Background: Vedic Mathematics in Digital Design
Vedic mathematics is an ancient system notable for parallel, systematic arithmetic, ideal for
VLSI implementation. The Urdhva Tiryakbhyam (vertical and crosswise) sutra enables fast
multiplications and additions with parallelism and minimal carry latency. Its integration
reduces critical path delay and power, while maintaining compactness and scalability.

4 Design Methodology
4.1 Novelty and Innovation
This work uniquely blends:

The parallel-prefix Kogge-stone adder for logarithmic carry resolution.
The Vedic comparator for streamlined modulo detection.
Tapeout-aware I/O pin architecture matching foundry requirements.
Fully automated, open-source RTL-to-GDS flow usingLibreLane(Yosys,
OpenROAD, and KLayout).
This integrated approach elevates the project for academic prestige and practical tapeout
readiness.
